Self-Evaluation (Fourth Major Work of 2025)

This was my fourth major research contribution in 2025. The work was submitted and accepted to the IJCNLP 2025 Shared Task (NLP-AI4Health), and I presented this work virtually as part of the shared task proceedings  ￼.

Research Task and Contribution

This work focused on multilingual clinical dialogue summarization and structured information extraction. The shared task required systems to process doctor–patient conversations in multiple languages and generate:
	•	A concise English clinical summary
	•	A structured JSON medical record
	•	Question–answer responses in the original language

Handling all three tasks reliably across ten languages, including low-resource Indic languages, was the main challenge.

System Design and My Contributions

I contributed to the design and implementation of a lightweight but effective pipeline using Qwen-1.5B, fine-tuned with LoRA adapters for parameter-efficient training.

Key contributions include:
	•	Designing a modular inference pipeline that separates:
	•	Summary generation
	•	Structured information extraction
	•	Multilingual Q&A
	•	Implementing a field-by-field JSON extraction strategy, instead of generating the full schema in one shot
	•	This significantly improved schema correctness and completeness
	•	Ensured valid and usable JSON outputs
	•	Creating role-based prompt templates for each task to ensure consistent and controlled outputs
	•	Optimizing the system to work under strict hardware and time constraints, including:
	•	Single-epoch fine-tuning
	•	Quantized 4-bit inference
	•	Efficient checkpoint handling

Evaluation and Results

The system was evaluated using official shared task metrics, and achieved:
	•	Strong semantic quality in summarization (high BERT-based scores)
	•	Competitive question-answering performance across languages
	•	Reliable structured extraction, producing schema-compliant JSON records even in low-resource languages

Despite limited training time and resources, the system showed stable multilingual behavior and factual consistency, demonstrating the effectiveness of the design choices.

Presentation and Visibility

I presented this work virtually at IJCNLP 2025, explaining the system design, challenges, and results to the shared task and research community. This contributed to the visibility of our work and organization in the area of multilingual healthcare NLP.

Overall Impact

This fourth work of 2025 demonstrates my ability to:
	•	Deliver multiple research outputs in a single year
	•	Work on multilingual and low-resource NLP challenges
	•	Design robust systems under tight compute constraints
	•	Balance research goals with practical system engineering
	•	Contribute to international shared tasks and community benchmarks

Overall, this project strengthened my skills in multilingual NLP, efficient fine-tuning, structured information extraction, and applied healthcare AI, and added further research visibility to the organization.

If you want, next I can:
	•	Merge all four 2025 works into one powerful annual summary
	•	Create a 1-page “2025 Research Highlights” section
	•	Rewrite everything in a promotion-oriented or leadership tone

Just tell me what you want next 👍
