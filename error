Below is a complete, patent-style draft for all questions.
Language is intentionally technical, implementation-focused, and non-academic, structured the way patent attorneys expect.
I’ve avoided research-paper style claims (e.g., “trustworthiness,” “framework”) and focused on systems, methods, and mechanisms, which are what patents protect.

1. Field of the Invention

The invention relates to computational systems for automated reasoning, specifically:
	•	multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems,
	•	real-time safety supervision of AI-generated actions,
	•	automated generation and logging of machine reasoning traces, and
	•	quantitative assessment of AI decision reliability.

The invention lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, diagnostic decision support, and safety-critical automated reasoning systems.

⸻

2. Business Problem Addressed

Current AI systems—especially LLMs—are:
	•	opaque (no explanation of why outputs were generated),
	•	unsafe in high-risk environments (e.g., healthcare, finance, legal),
	•	unreliable (answers change with small prompt variations), and
	•	impossible to audit after deployment.

Businesses cannot deploy LLMs in regulated industries because they cannot demonstrate:
	•	how the model arrived at a decision,
	•	whether the model considered safety constraints,
	•	whether the output is internally consistent, and
	•	whether the model’s reasoning changed over time.

This creates legal, regulatory, and operational risk and prevents adoption of AI-assisted decision pipelines.

⸻

3. Technology Gap in Existing Systems

Existing systems fail to provide:

a. Real-time reasoning transparency

LLMs produce only final answers, not a verifiable trace of intermediate reasoning steps.

b. Structured multi-agent deliberation

There is no system where multiple AI agents independently reason, compare results, and automatically quantify their epistemic disagreement.

c. Embedded safety supervision

Current AI frameworks either apply post-hoc content filters or rule-based checks. None provide:
	•	real-time test validation,
	•	real-time prescription/action validation,
	•	real-time risk classification,
	•	with explicit logs showing how safety influenced the decision.

d. Quantitative trust scoring

Current tools lack a measurable index of:
	•	reasoning consistency,
	•	agent disagreement,
	•	safety risk,
	•	operational prudence.

e. Forensic auditability

Existing LLM systems do not keep complete, structured logs for:
	•	reasoning evolution,
	•	inter-agent communication,
	•	rejected unsafe steps,
	•	decisions made under uncertainty.

⸻

4. Technical Solution (High-Level Explanation)

The invention introduces a multi-agent AI decision system with:

A. Independent Agent Reasoning

Multiple “reasoning agents” analyze the same case in parallel, each generating:
	•	structured reasoning traces,
	•	test orders,
	•	diagnostic hypotheses.

B. Consensus Disagreement Module

A dedicated module computes a Consensus Disagreement Rate (CDR) using:

CDR = 1 − (max votes for a diagnosis) / K

This quantifies epistemic uncertainty.

C. Embedded Safety Supervisor Agents

A “Safety Agent Layer” intercepts:
	•	diagnostic test actions,
	•	prescriptions or interventions.

It classifies each as SAFE, CAUTION, or UNSAFE, using:
	•	drug–drug interaction databases,
	•	rule-based validators,
	•	LLM-based classifiers.

Unsafe actions are rejected and logged.

D. Reasoning Trace Generator

Each reasoning step is stored in structured form inside <thinking_process> tags, including:
	•	intermediate hypotheses,
	•	evidence considered,
	•	eliminated hypotheses,
	•	safety feedback received.

E. Causal Logging and Traceability Engine

All agent exchanges are stored as structured records:

⟨timestamp, agent_id, action, reasoning_state, safety_flag, consensus_state⟩

This enables forensic replay.

F. Trust Scoring Engine

Computes three indices:
	1.	ETI — Epistemic Trust Index
Combines accuracy, CDR, and reasoning–diagnosis consistency.
	2.	OSI — Operational Safety Index
Computes a penalty-based measure of unsafe actions and alerts.
If safety is OFF → OSI = 0.
	3.	FTI — Final Trust Index
A composite of ETI and OSI.

This produces a quantitative trust score for any AI decision pipeline.

6. Technological Advancement (Non-Obviousness)

A. Multi-agent parallel reasoning with quantitative uncertainty

Prior systems do not combine parallel independent LLM reasoning with a mathematically grounded disagreement metric.

B. Real-time safety constraints that modify reasoning

Unlike post-hoc filters, the invention’s safety agents operate inside the reasoning loop, dynamically shaping the model’s decisions.

C. Full causal traceability

Current LLM systems cannot reconstruct “why” an AI made a decision.
This invention logs:
	•	full reasoning sequence,
	•	rejected unsafe choices,
	•	consensus voting behavior.

This level of traceability is not present in any commercial LLM product.

D. Quantitative trust indices

The invention introduces computable trust metrics, enabling:
	•	regulatory compliance,
	•	audit trails,
	•	safety certifications.

E. Integration of all components

The system is novel in integrating:
	•	multi-agent reasoning
	•	embedded safety
	•	causal logging
	•	trust scoring

into a single unified architecture.

This combination is non-obvious because existing systems treat these components as separate research problems.

8. Working Examples / Use Cases

Provide two types: a success case and a failure case with safety intervention.

⸻

Example 1 — Correct Diagnostic Reasoning with Safety Checks (from your dataset)

Input:
Patient with diplopia, ptosis, weakness worsening with exertion; positive antibody tests; abnormal EMG.

System behavior:
	•	All 3 reasoning agents independently diagnose Myasthenia Gravis
	•	Consensus disagreement CDR = 0
	•	Safety agent approves test orders
	•	Prescription: Edrophonium test flagged SAFE WITH CAUTION
	•	Trace logs show hypothesis evolution and evidence integration

Outcome:
Final diagnosis correct.
ETI high, OSI high, FTI high.

⸻

Example 2 — Misdiagnosis with Correct Safety Intervention (failure case)

Input:
Infant with abdominal distension, decreased feeding, transition zone on barium enema (Hirschsprung disease).

System behavior:
	•	Reasoning agent incorrectly suggests Intussusception
	•	CDR = 0 (all agents wrong in same direction)
	•	Prescription agent proposes “no medication”
	•	Safety agent flags this as UNSAFE (requires medical evaluation before withholding treatment)
	•	Logs show the exact reasoning paths and safety override

Outcome:
Diagnosis incorrect → low ETI.
Safety prevented inappropriate progression → OSI remains meaningful.
FTI reflects the risk despite accuracy failure.
