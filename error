During this year, I worked on a research and development project focused on using Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize large and complex clinical tables. This work resulted in three major outcomes: a top-tier research publication, a filed patent, and a working end-to-end system.

Research Work and Publication

I worked on a research problem where existing LLMs fail to handle very large clinical tables and often miss important facts or generate incorrect summaries. To solve this, I designed a method that selects only the most important facts from tables before giving them to the LLM.

This work was accepted at NAACL 2025 (CL4Health Workshop), which is a well-known international NLP conference. The acceptance shows that the problem and solution are relevant and novel. The paper clearly demonstrates improvements in accuracy, completeness, and reliability of generated summaries compared to existing approaches.

Patent Filing

Based on the novelty of the fact-selection approach and the overall system design, a patent has been filed for this work. This helps protect the idea and adds long-term value to the organization’s intellectual property portfolio.

End-to-End System Development

In addition to research, I built a complete working pipeline using Streamlit. The system:
	•	Takes large clinical tables as input
	•	Automatically identifies table types
	•	Selects only important facts using a configurable threshold
	•	Allows users to control how much information is included
	•	Outputs a clean, focused table containing only relevant facts

This system reduces manual effort and can be directly used by medical writers or reviewers.

Collaboration and Practical Focus

I worked closely with domain experts (medical writers) to ensure that the outputs are correct, meaningful, and follow expected formats. Their feedback was used to improve both the fact-selection logic and the final outputs.

Overall Impact

This work shows my ability to:
	•	Take ownership from idea to research to implementation
	•	Convert research ideas into practical, usable systems
	•	Contribute to publications, patents, and real products
	•	Work on complex problems in the healthcare and AI domain

Overall, this project had strong research impact, business value, and practical usability, and it helped strengthen my skills in LLMs, structured data processing, and applied AI systems.
