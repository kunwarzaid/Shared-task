Got it 👍
Here’s the final, simple-language self-evaluation, updated to clearly state that this was your second major work in 2025. This version fits very well in annual appraisal forms.

Self-Evaluation (Second Major Work in 2025)

This was my second major research and system development work in the year 2025. The project focused on building a safe and reliable LLM-based medical system using a multi-agent architecture.

Research Work and Industry Conference

This work was submitted and accepted in the Industry Track of an AI-ML Systems conference, highlighting its practical and industry relevance. I travelled to the conference and presented the work, explaining the system design, safety mechanisms, and results to an international audience. This helped showcase our work and organization in a real-world, industry-focused research forum.

My Role and Contributions

My main contributions in this project were:
	•	Designing the overall system architecture
	•	Building the multi-agent workflow and controller
	•	Implementing safety guardrails, including:
	•	Test safety checks
	•	Prescription safety checks using drug–drug interaction data
	•	Developing logging and traceability to ensure transparency and auditability
	•	Supporting experiments, analysis, and paper writing
	•	Preparing and delivering the conference presentation

The differential diagnosis component of the system was developed by my colleague as part of our collaborative effort. My work mainly focused on system design, safety, integration, and evaluation.

Impact and Results

The system showed improved diagnostic accuracy and significantly better detection of unsafe prescriptions compared to baseline approaches. It demonstrates how LLMs can be safely used in healthcare by enforcing structured workflows and safety checks at the system level.

Overall Impact

This second work of 2025 demonstrates my ability to:
	•	Deliver multiple high-impact projects in a single year
	•	Balance research quality with practical system building
	•	Collaborate effectively while owning critical components
	•	Represent the organization at international industry conferences

Overall, this project added strong research visibility and practical value, and further strengthened my skills in LLM systems, agent-based architectures, and AI safety in healthcare.

If you want, I can now:
	•	Combine both 2025 works into a single powerful appraisal summary
	•	Rewrite this in a promotion-oriented tone
	•	Convert it into a one-paragraph executive summary

Just say the word.
