Great point — that strengthens the practical validation angle a lot 👍
Here is the updated version, with that point added cleanly and simply, without sounding like marketing.

Self-Evaluation (Third Major Work of 2025)

This was my third major research and system development work in 2025. The work was submitted and accepted at an AAAI workshop, and the patent filing for this work is currently in progress.

Research Contribution and Novelty

This work addresses an important gap in healthcare AI: accuracy alone is not enough to trust an AI system. For real-world use, systems must also be explainable, safe, and accountable.

A key contribution of this work is that we proposed novel metrics to quantitatively measure trustworthiness, explainability, and safety in LLM-based systems. Instead of relying only on accuracy, we introduced:
	•	Metrics to measure reasoning reliability and consistency
	•	Metrics to check whether the reasoning aligns with the final decision
	•	Metrics to measure safe system behavior, such as detection of unsafe tests and prescriptions
	•	A combined trust score that captures both reasoning quality and safety behavior

This is a theoretical and conceptual contribution, as it defines trust as a measurable property of the system, rather than a subjective or manual assessment.

System and Application Development

Along with the research, I built a complete web-based application using Streamlit that demonstrates and validates the proposed ideas.

The application includes multiple interacting agents:
	•	Doctor agent
	•	Measurement agent
	•	Test safety agent
	•	Prescription writer agent
	•	Prescription safety agent
	•	Dietary advisor agent

Key features of the system:
	•	Drug–drug interaction checks using an external medical database
	•	PDF and image upload support for medical reports
	•	Generation of a final structured doctor report
	•	Agent-to-agent interaction, not just linear execution

For example:
	•	If the doctor agent recommends a test that is unsafe, the test safety agent flags it
	•	The doctor and safety agents then discuss and recommend a safer alternative
	•	Similar safety checks are applied during prescription generation

Explainability, Traceability, and Transparency

The system is designed so that every decision is explainable and traceable:
	•	Every agent action is logged
	•	Each decision can be traced back to the input, agent, and reasoning step
	•	The thinking process of the LLMs is explicitly captured
	•	This makes the system suitable for regulated and high-risk domains

Internal Validation and Testing

To validate the system beyond experiments, the application was tested with associates in the Delhi Lab. Their usage and feedback helped verify:
	•	System usability
	•	Clarity of explanations and logs
	•	Practical usefulness of safety alerts and traceability

This internal testing strengthened confidence in the system’s real-world applicability, not just its research value.

Overall Contribution and Impact

This third work of 2025 demonstrates my ability to:
	•	Propose novel evaluation metrics and theoretical frameworks
	•	Build end-to-end, production-like applications
	•	Combine research innovation with practical validation
	•	Work on trustworthy, explainable, and safe AI systems
	•	Deliver multiple high-impact research contributions in a single year

Overall, this project adds strong value to the organization in the area of trustworthy AI, and highlights my ability to translate advanced research ideas into usable and validated systems.

If you want, I can now:
	•	Merge all three 2025 works into one strong annual summary
	•	Reduce this to a very short HR form version
	•	Rewrite everything in a promotion-oriented tone

Just tell me what you need next 🙂
