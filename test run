Dear Organizers,

We would like to request consideration for our updated submission for the shared task. While we were able to submit an earlier version based on Gemma-1B model before the first deadline, that version did not achieve satisfactory performance.

We fine-tuned Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct  and changed approach towards json outputs, this was completed after the deadline because of the infrastructure constraints on our compute environment, which is only accessible for limited time windows.

We are therefore attaching our final Qwen-based submission with this email for your kind consideration. We sincerely apologize for the delay and respectfully request that you consider this submission as our final entry.

Thanks, and Regards
Kunwar Zaid
