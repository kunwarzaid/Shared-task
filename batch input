\subsection{6. Trust Metrics: From Transparency to Quantification}

Traditional safety frameworks treat correctness and harm prevention separately. 
However, clinical trust requires both \textit{epistemic reliability} (the model reasons soundly and consistently) and \textit{operational safety} (its actions are risk-aware).  
MedGuard-X quantifies these two pillars through interpretable composite metrics: the \textbf{Epistemic Trust Index (ETI)}, the \textbf{Operational Safety Index (OSI)}, and their balanced fusion, the \textbf{Final Trust Index (FTI)}.

\paragraph{(a) Epistemic Trust Index (ETI).}
The ETI captures the reliability and internal coherence of diagnostic reasoning.  
It combines three complementary dimensions: factual accuracy, inter-agent agreement, and reasoning–diagnosis coherence.

\[
\mathrm{ETI} = 0.4 \times \mathrm{Accuracy} + 0.3 \times (100 - \mathrm{CDR}) + 0.3 \times \mathrm{RDC},
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Accuracy} (\%) is the proportion of cases where the final diagnosis matches the expert or clinically equivalent answer;
    \item \textbf{CDR} (\textit{Consensus Disagreement Rate}) quantifies epistemic instability—i.e., how often Doctor Agents disagree on the same case;
    \item \textbf{RDC} (\textit{Reasoning–Diagnosis Coherence}) measures the semantic alignment between a model’s reasoning trace and its chosen diagnosis.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Definition of RDC.}
Because the \textit{MedQA} dataset lacks clinician-authored rationales, RDC serves as a proxy for reasoning fidelity.  
For each case $i$, let $t_i$ denote the reasoning text (inside \texttt{<thinking\_process>}) and $d_i$ the final diagnosis.  
We compute:
\[
\mathrm{RDC}_i = 50 \times (1 + \cos(E(t_i), E(d_i))),
\]
where $E(\cdot)$ encodes text using a biomedical sentence-transformer (e.g., BioClinicalBERT), and $\cos$ denotes cosine similarity.  
The scaling maps RDC to $[0,100]$, enabling comparability with accuracy and CDR.

High RDC indicates that the Doctor Agent’s reasoning linguistically supports its diagnosis—analogous to a clinician’s justification matching their impression.  
RDC thus quantifies internal consistency, not factual correctness.

This directly addresses a key reviewer question:  
\textit{How can internal reasoning quality be measured when ground-truth rationales are unavailable?}  
By using embedding-level semantic alignment, MedGuard-X makes reasoning coherence measurable.

\paragraph{(b) Operational Safety Index (OSI).}
While ETI evaluates epistemic reliability, OSI captures behavioral safety during clinical action generation:
\[
\mathrm{OSI} = 100 - \frac{1}{2} \big(\text{Unsafe Rx \%} + \text{Test Safety Alerts \%}\big).
\]
Here, the first term penalizes prescriptions rated as \textit{UNSAFE} or \textit{SAFE WITH CAUTION}, and the second accounts for flagged diagnostic tests.  
A high OSI indicates that the model consistently avoids risky or redundant clinical actions.

\paragraph{(c) Final Trust Index (FTI).}
The FTI aggregates epistemic and operational reliability into a single interpretable measure:
\[
\mathrm{FTI} = 0.5 \times \mathrm{ETI} + 0.5 \times \mathrm{OSI}.
\]
This balanced weighting reflects that a clinically trustworthy system must both \textit{reason soundly} and \textit{act safely}.  
Empirically, these components are only weakly correlated—demonstrating that trust cannot be inferred from accuracy alone.

\paragraph{Interpretation.}
Together, ETI, OSI, and FTI capture three distinct but complementary layers of trust:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Epistemic trust (ETI):} “Can we trust what it thinks?”
    \item \textbf{Operational trust (OSI):} “Can we trust what it does?”
    \item \textbf{Final trust (FTI):} “Can we trust it overall?”
\end{enumerate}
This hierarchy decomposes trustworthiness into measurable components—moving beyond the simplistic equation of accuracy with reliability.
