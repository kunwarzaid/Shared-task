This paper describes our submission to the
NLP-AI4Health 2025 Shared Task on multi-
lingual clinical dialogue summarization and
structured information extraction. Our system
is based on Qwen-1.5B Instruct fine-tuned with
LoRA adapters for parameter-efficient adapta-
tion. The pipeline produces (i) concise English
summaries, (ii) schema-aligned JSON outputs,
and (iii) multilingual Q&A responses. The
Qwen-based approach substantially improves
summary fluency, factual completeness, and
JSON field coverage while maintaining effi-
ciency within constrained GPU resources.
