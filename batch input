Subject: Request for Correction of Submission â€” Patient-Centric Question Answering Shared Task

Dear Organizing Committee,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention that my paper was inadvertently submitted to the BHASHA workshop instead of the Patient-Centric Question Answering Shared Task.

Please find the correct submission attached with this email. I kindly request that you consider this paper under the appropriate shared task track â€” Patient-Centric QA. The submission was prepared specifically for that task, and the incorrect upload was an unintentional error during the submission process.

I sincerely apologize for the confusion and appreciate your understanding and support in resolving this matter.

Warm regards,
Kunwar Zaid
