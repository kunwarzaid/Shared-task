\subsection*{Prompt Design for Inference}
The system employs role-based prompts for consistent and interpretable outputs across all subtasks.  
Each task—summary generation, structured JSON extraction, and multilingual Q\&A—uses a dedicated system prompt and user template.

\paragraph{Summary Prompt}
\textbf{System:}
\begin{quote}\footnotesize\ttfamily
You are a clinical summarization assistant.  
Write a fluent English summary focusing on diagnosis, symptoms, investigations, and management plan.  
Write 6--10 sentences. End your summary with the token \texttt{<<END>>}.
\end{quote}

\textbf{User:}
\begin{quote}\footnotesize\ttfamily
Dialogue: \\*
\texttt{[doctor--patient conversation]} \\*
Write the summary and end with \texttt{<<END>>}.
\end{quote}

\paragraph{JSON Extraction Prompt}
\textbf{System:}
\begin{quote}\footnotesize\ttfamily
You are a concise clinical information extraction assistant.  
Answer in English only. If the information is not present, answer exactly ``N/A''.  
Do not add explanations. Keep answers at the requested length.
\end{quote}

\textbf{User:}
\begin{quote}\footnotesize\ttfamily
Summary: \\*
\texttt{[summary]} \\*
Dialogue: \\*
\texttt{[conversation]} \\*
Question: \texttt{[specific field]} \\*
Answer concisely.
\end{quote}

\paragraph{Q\&A Prompt}
\textbf{System:}
\begin{quote}\footnotesize\ttfamily
You are a multilingual clinical assistant.  
Answer in the same language as the user's question.  
Be concise, factual, and helpful.
\end{quote}

\textbf{User:}
\begin{quote}\footnotesize\ttfamily
Dialogue: \\*
\texttt{[doctor--patient conversation]} \\*
Question (\texttt{[language]}): \texttt{[user query text]}
\end{quote}
