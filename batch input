\begin{abstract}
This paper describes our submission to the NLP-AI4Health 2025 Shared Task on multilingual clinical dialogue summarization and information extraction. 
Our system is built on Qwen-1.5B Instruct fine-tuned with LoRA adapters for efficiency. 
It produces (i) concise English summaries of doctor--patient dialogues, (ii) structured JSON outputs capturing key medical entities, and (iii) multilingual Q\&A responses. 
Compared to our baseline (Gemma-1B), the Qwen-based approach significantly improves summary fluency, factual completeness, and JSON field coverage while operating within strict computational constraints.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The clinical dialogue summarization task aims to convert doctor--patient interactions into concise, structured summaries suitable for medical documentation. 
The 2025 Shared Task extends this challenge to multilingual dialogues in 10 Indic and English languages. 
We present a parameter-efficient approach using Qwen-1.5B Instruct with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), optimized for factual summarization and schema-aligned information extraction. 
Our system is designed for robustness under constrained GPU resources and to generalize across diverse linguistic contexts.

\subsection{Model Configuration}
We use the Qwen-1.5B Instruct checkpoint as the base model, quantized to 4-bit NF4 precision via \texttt{BitsAndBytes} for efficient training and inference. 
LoRA adapters were trained using the PEFT library with rank $r=8$, $\alpha=32$, dropout $0.05$, and target modules \texttt{q\_proj} and \texttt{v\_proj}. 
Training used the AdamW optimizer with learning rate $2\times10^{-4}$ and cosine decay.

\subsection{Inference Pipeline}
Dialogues are processed per language folder. 
Each input is truncated to 32k tokens and passed through three stages:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Summary Generation:} Generate a factual English summary ending with the sentinel token \texttt{<<END>>}.
    \item \textbf{Structured JSON Extraction:} Answer per-field questions to fill the schema.
    \item \textbf{Multilingual Q\&A:} Answer task questions in the original dialogue language.
\end{enumerate}

Decoding uses greedy inference (\texttt{do\_sample=False}) for stable, deterministic outputs.

\subsection{Structured JSON Extraction}
A core component of our system is the generation of structured clinical records in JSON format. 
Instead of prompting the model to generate the entire schema in one go---which often resulted in incomplete or invalid JSON---we treat each schema entry as an independent question--answer task. 

Each field (e.g., \textit{chief\_complaint}, \textit{past\_medical\_history}) is represented as a natural language question, for example:
\begin{quote}
\small
\texttt{Question: What is the patient's chief complaint? Answer in English, maximum 20 words. If unknown, reply exactly ``N/A.''}
\end{quote}

The dialogue and its summary are provided as context, and the model generates one short factual answer per field. 
Post-processing expands dotted keys (e.g., \textit{demographics.age}) into nested JSON objects and formats list fields (e.g., \textit{associated\_symptoms}) using semicolon separation. 

This modular approach yields:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stability:} Avoids malformed JSON.
    \item \textbf{Completeness:} Missing fields can be selectively re-generated.
    \item \textbf{Auditability:} Each extracted field can be traced and validated individually.
\end{itemize}

Empirically, this design improved JSON field coverage by approximately threefold compared to single-shot generation.

\section{Dataset and Preprocessing}
We used the multilingual clinical dialogue dataset provided by the organizers, containing 10 languages: English, Hindi, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Kannada, Bangla, Assamese, and Dogri. 
Dialogues were concatenated turn-wise and normalized for whitespace and encoding. 
Unlike early experiments with romanized text, the final pipeline used native Indic scripts directly, leveraging Qwen’s multilingual tokenizer.

\section{Experimental Setup and Results}
\subsection{Baselines}
We initially submitted results using Gemma-1B, which showed poor multilingual fluency and incomplete structured outputs. 
Our Qwen-LoRA configuration replaced it for the final submission after infrastructure delays.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
(Results to be inserted once official evaluation scores are released.) 
We expect improvements across ROUGE-L for summaries, JSON field completion rate, and language accuracy for Q\&A.

\subsection{Qualitative Analysis}
Manual inspection indicates that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Summaries are concise, fluent, and factually grounded.
    \item JSON outputs are structurally valid with substantially higher completion.
    \item Q\&A responses are correctly localized to the dialogue’s language.
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
The main challenges included limited GPU access, checkpoint restarts due to infrastructure timeouts, and language imbalance (low-resource Dogri and Assamese). 
The modular inference design mitigated these by enabling checkpoint resumption and selective skipping of processed languages.

Ablation showed that field-by-field extraction and using native scripts were critical to accuracy. 
Romanization or direct JSON prompting led to high rates of invalid or null fields.

\section{Conclusion}
We presented a multilingual clinical summarization and extraction system using Qwen-1.5B with LoRA adapters. 
The approach balances factual accuracy, language generalization, and computational efficiency. 
Future work will explore retrieval-augmented factual grounding, factual consistency scoring, and extension to larger Qwen models.
