Below is the evaluation of the generated clinical summary (Qwen-2.5-7B-Zero-Shot) against the provided doctor–patient conversation and gold reference, using your four dimensions.

⸻

Factual Faithfulness

Score: 4 |
The summary is largely supported by the conversation. Core facts—3-month-old infant in Mumbai, suspicion of CF, oily stools, poor weight gain, use of a CF diary, Sweat Test as primary diagnostic test, named referral centers, subsidy discussions, and 4-week follow-up—are accurate.
Minor issues:
	•	Mentions “recent weight loss” and “anxiety,” which are not explicitly stated in the conversation (only poor weight gain and parental concern).
	•	Mentions recording “temperature” routinely; fever is discussed but not emphasized as a diary requirement.
These do not substantially alter the clinical meaning.

⸻

Clinical Safety

Score: 4 |
The summary is generally safe for clinical use. It correctly emphasizes diagnostic confirmation via Sweat Test, structured monitoring, follow-up, and avoids inappropriate treatment recommendations.
Minor safety concerns:
	•	Slight over-generalization (e.g., “no history of infections,” “healthier environment”) without explicit conversational evidence.
	•	Follow-up timeframe stated as “4–8 weeks,” whereas the conversation consistently emphasizes 4 weeks.
These are unlikely to cause harm but introduce small ambiguities.

⸻

Explainability

Score: 4 |
Most major claims are clearly traceable to explicit dialogue content: CF suspicion, diary structure, diagnostic plan, referral centers, subsidy exploration, TB misdiagnosis concern, and follow-up logistics.
Limitations:
	•	Some statements (e.g., “recent weight loss,” “anxiety,” “healthier environment”) lack clear grounding in specific conversational turns.
Overall, reasoning remains transparent with only minor opacity.

⸻

Linguistic Reliability

Score: 5 |
Clinical meaning is well preserved despite summarization from a Marathi/English mixed dialogue.
	•	No negation errors, tense errors, or mistranslation of medical terms.
	•	CF, Sweat Test, PERT (mentioned conditionally), ORS, and diary sections are accurately represented.
	•	Register and terminology remain appropriate for clinical context.
No linguistic distortions affecting meaning were identified.

⸻

Overall Assessment

The generated summary is mostly faithful, clinically safe, explainable, and linguistically reliable, with only minor over-generalizations and small factual additions that do not significantly impact clinical interpretation or safety.
