Trust-X models clinical diagnosis as an interaction between multiple specialized agents:

• Patient Agent  
  Provides consistent symptoms and history  

• K Doctor Agents  
  Independently reason, form hypotheses, and propose diagnoses  

• Consensus Module  
  Aggregates diagnoses and computes diagnostic disagreement (CDR)  

• Test Safety Agent  
  Reviews each diagnostic test for redundancy or risk  

• Prescription Safety Agent  
  Flags unsafe or contraindicated medications  

• Explainability & Logging Layer  
  Records every reasoning step, safety alert, and decision  

• Trust Metric Engine  
  Computes ETI (reasoning), OSI (safety), and FTI (overall trust)
