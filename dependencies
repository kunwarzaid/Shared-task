“Lessons Learned from Evaluation of LLM based Multi-agents in Safer Therapy Recommendation” (Wu et al., 2025).

Differentiation of Trust-X vs

“Lessons Learned from Evaluation of LLM based Multi-agents in Safer Therapy Recommendation” (Wu et al., 2025)

High-level distinction (core inventive boundary)

The cited work by Wu et al. investigates the use of LLM-based multi-agent collaboration to improve therapy recommendations, particularly for multimorbidity, with an emphasis on conflict resolution and medication optimization.

In contrast, Trust-X is not a therapy-planning or recommendation system.
It is a framework for measuring and quantifying trustworthiness of LLM reasoning, focusing on:
	•	epistemic uncertainty,
	•	reasoning transparency,
	•	reasoning–decision consistency, and
	•	operational safety behavior.

Trust-X evaluates how reliably an LLM reasons and acts, not how well it optimizes a treatment plan.

Point-by-point technical differentiators

1. Decision-support system vs trust-evaluation framework

Wu et al.
	•	Primary goal: improve therapy recommendations.
	•	Multi-agent discussion is used to:
	•	resolve DDIs,
	•	reduce medication burden,
	•	converge on a better prescription.
	•	Evaluation focuses on quality of final treatment plans.

Trust-X (Inventive Step)
	•	Primary goal: measure trustworthiness of LLM behavior.
	•	Does not attempt to improve or optimize treatment plans.
	•	Evaluates:
	•	epistemic stability of diagnoses,
	•	transparency of reasoning,
	•	safety supervision behavior.
	•	Trust is treated as a measurable system property, not an outcome improvement.

➡ Trust-X addresses a different technical problem than Wu et al.

⸻

2. Conflict-resolution consensus vs epistemic uncertainty quantification

Wu et al.
	•	Consensus is used as a mechanism to resolve conflicts.
	•	Goal of consensus: produce a single, improved prescription.
	•	Disagreement is treated as something to be eliminated.

Trust-X
	•	Consensus is used as a measurement signal, not a resolution mechanism.
	•	Introduces Consensus Disagreement Rate (CDR) to quantify epistemic uncertainty.
	•	Disagreement is preserved and measured, not resolved away.
	•	Higher disagreement = higher uncertainty, not lower performance.

➡ Using disagreement as a trust signal is not disclosed or suggested by Wu et al.

⸻

3. Treatment-focused metrics vs reasoning trust indices

Wu et al.
	•	Metrics include:
	•	DDI ratio,
	•	Contraindication ratio,
	•	Medication count,
	•	Improvement ratio vs baseline plan.
	•	All metrics are treatment-outcome-centric.

Trust-X
	•	Introduces new trust indices:
	•	Epistemic Trust Index (ETI),
	•	Operational Safety Index (OSI),
	•	Final Trust Index (FTI).
	•	Metrics combine:
	•	accuracy,
	•	reasoning stability,
	•	reasoning–diagnosis consistency,
	•	safety behavior under supervision.

➡ Wu et al. does not define or suggest trust as a composite measurable index.

⸻

4. Action optimization vs safety supervision as an evaluation signal

Wu et al.
	•	Safety checks are part of treatment optimization.
	•	Conflicts are resolved to generate a better prescription.
	•	Safety is an objective to improve.

Trust-X
	•	Safety agents act as independent monitors, not optimizers.
	•	Unsafe prescriptions and tests are logged and penalized, not corrected.
	•	OSI explicitly drops to zero when safety supervision is absent.
	•	Safety is used as a trustworthiness discriminator, not a planning goal.

➡ This distinction prevents “safe-by-omission” scoring and is absent in Wu et al.

⸻

5. No reasoning–decision alignment metric vs RDC

Wu et al.
	•	Evaluates completeness and correctness of treatment plans.
	•	Does not assess whether explanations align with decisions.

Trust-X
	•	Introduces Reasoning–Diagnosis Consistency (RDC).
	•	Measures semantic alignment between:
	•	reasoning trace,
	•	final decision.
	•	Detects coherent-but-unjustified reasoning.

➡ RDC addresses reasoning faithfulness, not present in Wu et al.

⸻

6. Domain-specific therapy planning vs domain-agnostic trust framework

Wu et al.
	•	Focused specifically on:
	•	multimorbidity,
	•	therapy planning,
	•	MDT simulation.
	•	Domain-dependent.

Trust-X
	•	Domain-agnostic framework.
	•	Applicable to:
	•	diagnosis,
	•	test ordering,
	•	prescription,
	•	any safety-critical reasoning task.
	•	Trust metrics are model- and domain-independent.

➡ Trust-X generalizes beyond therapy recommendation.

Examiner-facing concise differentiation (recommended paragraph)

The cited work by Wu et al. employs LLM-based multi-agent collaboration to improve therapy recommendations by resolving medication conflicts and optimizing prescriptions. In contrast, the present invention does not seek to improve or generate treatment plans. Instead, it introduces a system and method for measuring the trustworthiness of large language model reasoning, using epistemic uncertainty derived from multi-agent disagreement, reasoning–decision consistency, and real-time safety supervision as evaluation signals. Disagreement among agents is explicitly preserved and quantified as uncertainty, rather than resolved, and safety supervision is used to penalize unsafe behavior rather than optimize outcomes. These aspects are neither disclosed nor suggested in the cited work, which focuses on decision quality rather than trust measurement.

⸻

One-line differentiator (for claim mapping)

Wu et al. uses multi-agent systems to decide better, whereas Trust-X uses multi-agent systems to measure whether decisions can be trusted.

	•	Align differentiators to independent claim elements
	•	Prepare a tabular novelty comparison
	•	Help you draft dependent claims that clearly avoid this prior art
