\subsection{Model Configuration}

All agents in Trust-X were instantiated using Google Gemini models, selected for their strong medical reasoning performance and instruction-following reliability. 
Doctor Agents were implemented using \textit{Gemini 2.5 Pro}, while Patient, Measurement, and Safety Agents used \textit{Gemini 2.5 Flash} for efficiency and controlled responses.

\paragraph{Doctor Agent Replicas.}
The $K$ Doctor Agents are \emph{architecturally identical} and share the same underlying model weights. 
They are not role-specialized or trained differently. 
Epistemic diversity arises solely from independent stochastic decoding (controlled temperature sampling) and independent interaction trajectories with the Patient and Measurement agents.

Each Doctor Agent:
(i) receives the same initial case description,
(ii) reasons independently without access to other agents’ intermediate states, and
(iii) produces a complete diagnostic reasoning trace and final diagnosis.
This design mirrors clinical practice, where multiple physicians independently assess the same patient before consensus.

\paragraph{Consensus Diversity.}
Differences among Doctor Agents therefore reflect \emph{model uncertainty} rather than engineered specialization.
This allows diagnostic disagreement to serve as a direct, behavior-based proxy for epistemic uncertainty, quantified through the Consensus Disagreement Rate (CDR).

\paragraph{Embedding Configuration.}
Reasoning–diagnosis consistency was computed using sentence embeddings from \texttt{SentenceTransformer(all-MiniLM-L6-v2)}, selected for its strong semantic alignment performance and low variance across medical text.
