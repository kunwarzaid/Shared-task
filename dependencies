The paper identifies a fundamental challenge: as AI systems become more powerful, autonomous, and are used in sensitive or safety-critical contexts (e.g. healthcare, transportation, infrastructure), it becomes increasingly important that they behave reliably and do not cause harm
Current AI safety validation mostly relies on empirical testing / red-teaming, i.e. trying to find unsafe behaviours by testing the AI in many situations
But this is fundamentally limited: no matter how much you test, you can never exhaustively cover all possible inputs or environments. That means there could always be rare, hidden, adversarial, or unexpected scenarios where the AI misbehaves
Rising relevance and urgency: As AI becomes more capable and deployed in sensitive domains (automation, healthcare, infrastructure, decision-making), demand for reliable safety guarantees — beyond “it worked in tests” — will only increase.

The International AI Safety Report (IASR) is a major, global collaborative effort: 96 independent AI experts from around the world (nominated by 30 countries, plus UN, EU, OECD) contributed.
Its purpose: to synthesize current scientific understanding of the capabilities, risks, and safety-mitigation strategies for advanced general-purpose AI systems (i.e. AI that can perform a wide variety of tasks).
The report reviews recent advances: general-purpose AI systems are already showing strong performance in programming, abstract reasoning, scientific reasoning, and other complex tasks.
It argues such capabilities are likely to continue improving — meaning these systems will become increasingly powerful, flexible, and widely deployed
The report categorizes risks into several major types.

+1

Malicious Use Risks:

Creation of fake content, deepfakes — can facilitate fraud, manipulation, misinformation. 
arXiv

Manipulation of public opinion or social discourse at scale. 
arXiv

Cyber-offences or automated cyberattacks. 
arXiv

Even more dangerous: potential for bio- or chemical-attack facilitation (e.g. AI-generated instructions).
Malfunction Risks / Reliability Issues:

AI systems may behave unpredictably, produce biased or incorrect outputs, or degrade under distributional shifts. 
arXiv
+1

Risk of “loss of control” — as AI becomes more autonomous, we may lose the ability to guarantee safe behaviour in all conditions. 
arXiv

Systemic / Societal Risks:

Disruption to labor markets (automation replacing jobs). 
arXiv

Concentration of power: centralization of AI R&D or deployment could create “single points of failure.” 
arXiv

Environmental impacts (e.g. energy usage), privacy harms, copyright/IP risks. 
arXiv
+1

Widening global inequalities: the “AI R&D divide” — countries/organizations with resources may dominate the benefits and risks. 
arXiv

Impact of Open-weight / Open-access Models:

The report also warns that freely available models (“open-weight”) may increase risks, because they lower barriers for malicious or irresponsible use.
The report does not just list risks — it also surveys technical and governance approaches to manage and mitigate these risks. 
arXiv

Some of the approaches and considerations:

Training more trustworthy models — using better data, alignment techniques, robustness evaluation. 
arXiv

Ongoing monitoring & intervention — tracking deployed AI behavior; having mechanisms to intervene or shut down if unsafe behaviour arises. 
arXiv

Privacy-preserving designs — mitigating privacy and data misuse risks. 
arXiv
+1

Risk-identification & assessment frameworks — systematically evaluating potential harms before deployment. 
arXiv

Policymaker & governance engagement — because some risks are societal, not just technical. The report emphasizes the need for global cooperation.

At the same time, the report notes significant evidence gaps — many future risks remain uncertain and under-studied.
