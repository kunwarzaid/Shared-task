Great — let’s build a strong Methodology section for a computational linguistics / NLP conference paper (EACL).
I will write it in a clean academic style, with placeholders where you can later insert exact numbers, models, dataset sizes, etc.

Before I generate the full polished section, here is the outline I recommend for your paper based on the work you described:

3. Methodology

3.1 Task Definition

We study the problem of clinical dialogue summarisation for low-resource Indic languages, where the input consists of multi-turn doctor–patient conversations and the output is a concise English clinical summary appropriate for downstream clinical decision-making. The task is challenging due to:
	•	conversational noise and redundancies,
	•	mixed-language (code-switched) utterances,
	•	low availability of supervised data per language,
	•	specialised medical vocabulary, and
	•	long-context reasoning requirements.

Our goal is to evaluate whether explicit reasoning-style supervision improves the quality, factuality, and clinical usefulness of summaries produced by medium-scale open-source LLMs (LLaMA-2-13B, Qwen-1.5B/7B).

⸻

3.2 Dataset Description

We use the EACL Doctor–Patient Conversation Dataset, which includes dialogues and reference summaries for four Indic languages:
	•	Hindi
	•	Marathi
	•	Bangla
	•	Tamil

Each language directory contains:
	1.	Dialogues/ — scenario-level JSONL files containing turn-level doctor/patient utterances.
	2.	Summary_Text/ — corresponding English free-text reference summaries.

In addition, each scenario includes a structured JSON schema summarisation file created by domain experts. This schema contains clinically grounded fields (e.g., symptoms, investigations, safety red flags).

We train only on Hindi, Marathi, Bangla, and Tamil, but all results are compared at both language-specific and aggregated levels.

⸻

3.3 Baseline Summarisation Models

We establish baseline performance using off-the-shelf LLMs in a zero-shot or few-shot setting:
	•	LLaMA-2-13B-Chat (instruction-tuned)
	•	Qwen-1.5B and 7B (baseline for smaller models)

The baseline prompt is a conventional instruction-style input:

“Read the following doctor–patient dialogue and write a concise clinical summary in English.”

This represents typical summarisation without explicit reasoning supervision.

⸻

3.4 Domain-Style Reasoning Supervision (Domain-Style SFT)

To introduce structured reasoning, we derive a Domain-Style Reasoning Target for each training example.

Instead of training directly on the short reference summary, we convert each summary into a multi-paragraph, semantically decomposed reasoning explanation, covering:
	1.	Patient overview
	2.	Chief complaint
	3.	History of present illness
	4.	Risk factors & social history
	5.	Examination & investigations
	6.	Assessment & planning
	7.	Safety concerns / red flags
	8.	Overall clinical synthesis

This transformation is applied only to the training data.
During supervised fine-tuning (SFT), the model learns to produce structured reasoning narrative summaries.

Before fine-tuning, all XML-like tags are stripped, and the model sees only the multi-paragraph reasoning text, ensuring it learns content structure, not formatting.

The hypothesis is:

Explicit reasoning-style supervision teaches the model a more clinically grounded summarisation style, improving faithfulness, completeness, and factual structure compared to direct summary training.

⸻

3.5 Data Transformation Pipeline

The data transformation consists of three steps:
	1.	Input fusion — All dialogue turns are concatenated into a chronological input sequence with speaker markers.
	2.	Summary restructuring — The original English summary is rewritten using GPT-4 into the fixed reasoning schema described above.
	•	GPT-4 is constrained not to add clinical facts.
	•	Only re-structuring and clarification is allowed.
	3.	Tag stripping — The structured output is converted into a clean reasoning narrative.

This produces a parallel dataset:

(input dialogue) → (reasoning-style target)

We provide the exact mechanised prompts so the process is reproducible and language-agnostic.

⸻

3.6 Fine-Tuning Setup

We fine-tune two model families:
	•	LLaMA-2-13B-Chat (primary)
	•	Qwen-1.5B and Qwen-7B (secondary ablations)

Training details:
	•	Optimiser: AdamW
	•	Precision: FP16 or 4-bit quantised parameters (bitsandbytes)
	•	Max input length: 4k tokens
	•	Output length: 512–768 tokens
	•	Batch size: adjusted dynamically per GPU
	•	Training objective: next-token prediction on the reasoning-style summary
	•	Languages: Hindi, Marathi, Bangla, Tamil
	•	Validation split: held-out dev data per language

The chat template for LLaMA-2-13B-Chat ([INST] format or tokenizer chat template) is used consistently during both training and inference.

⸻

3.7 Inference-Time Prompting

At inference, the model receives only:
	•	the dialogue, and
	•	a simple, natural instruction requesting a clinical summary.

We test two variants:
	1.	Direct Summary Output — The model is asked to produce a concise summary.
	2.	Reasoning → Summary (Chain-of-Thought style) — The model is asked to first reason, then summarise (without exposing reasoning to evaluators).

Both allow us to measure whether reasoning-trained models outperform plain summary-trained ones.

⸻

3.8 Evaluation Framework

We evaluate across:

Automatic Metrics
	•	ROUGE-1 / ROUGE-2 / ROUGE-L
	•	BERTScore
	•	Clinical-BERT similarity scores
	•	Length-normalised faithfulness metrics

Human Clinical Evaluation

Experts judge each summary on:
	•	Faithfulness to the dialogue
	•	Clinical correctness
	•	Completeness
	•	Harm potential (missing red flags, hallucinated labs/tests)
	•	Readability

Model-based Evaluation (“LLM-as-Judge”)

We independently evaluate summaries using GPT-4 or LLaMA-3-70B with a rubric that measures:
	•	Coverage of symptoms
	•	Risk factor inclusion
	•	Diagnostic accuracy
	•	Plan completeness
	•	Absence of hallucinations
	•	Logical clarity of reasoning

The judge sees only summary + dialogue, not the model identity.

⸻

3.9 LLM-as-a-Judge Protocol

To avoid evaluation bias:
	1.	Each summary (baseline vs reasoning-trained) is paired with the original dialogue.
	2.	The judge model is prompted with a 10-criterion clinical evaluation rubric.
	3.	Scores are aggregated across languages and models.
	4.	Statistical tests (Wilcoxon signed-rank or paired t-tests) assess improvement significance.

This allows us to check whether reasoning-trained models systematically outperform baselines on clinical faithfulness and reasoning coherence.

✔️ Next Step

If you want, I can now generate:
	•	A polished camera-ready version of the Methodology
	•	A shortened version (if page limit is strict)
	•	A matching Results section template
	•	Methodology figure diagrams (flowcharts, model diagrams)

Just tell me which version you want next.
