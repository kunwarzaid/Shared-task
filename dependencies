Trust-X quantifies trust using three complementary indices:

• Epistemic Trust Index (ETI)  
  Measures how reliably the system reasons  
  Combines accuracy, consensus stability, and reasoning coherence  

• Operational Safety Index (OSI)  
  Measures how safely the system behaves  
  Penalizes unsafe prescriptions and risky diagnostic tests  

• Final Trust Index (FTI)  
  Overall trust score combining ETI and OSI  
  High only when both reasoning and safety are strong  

Supporting signals:
• CDR – how much the Doctor Agents disagree  
• RDC – how well reasoning matches the final diagnosis
