What GS AI Proposes

A research framework for Guaranteed Safe (GS) AI, built on:

World Model
Mathematical model describing how AI interacts with the real world.

Safety Specification
Formal definition of what “safe behavior” means in that context.

Verifier
A mechanism that produces auditable proof that the AI always stays within safety boundaries.

This moves AI safety from “we tested it a lot” → to quantifiable and certifiable safety guarantees.

Why Empirical Testing is Not Enough

Testing finds problems—but cannot prove the absence of problems.

Rare failures may only appear once deployed.

Adversarial triggers or environmental shifts break empirical assumptions.

For safety-critical systems (like aviation or medicine), this would be unacceptable engineering practice.
