  "assessment_primary_diagnosis": "The primary diagnostic focus was anophthalmic exophthalmos (bulging eye) associated with neck swelling, which prompted ENT referral and further investigation into head-and-neck pathology. The clinician emphasized that this symptom profile raised suspicion for a malignant process such as squamous cell carcinoma, but definitive diagnosis would require histopathology after biopsy. Imaging (CT or MRI) was planned to delineate tumor extent and aid staging. No firm diagnosis has been made yet; the plan remains to proceed with biopsy and obtain final pathology results to guide subsequent treatment decisions. The team also addressed supportive care considerations, including dietary guidance, dental hygiene, and cessation resources for tobacco and alcohol use. A multidisciplinary approach involving ENT, oncology, radiology, and nutritionists will shape the treatment pathway once the biopsy result is available. The patient and family were advised to prepare questions and stay engaged in the process. The overall goal is to identify the exact cause, stage disease, and tailor a comprehensive treatment plan. The visit concluded with a clear plan to schedule biopsy and obtain pathology results promptly.",
  "differential_diagnoses": "The list of potential differential diagnoses includes:\n\n1. Chronic upper airway irritation due to reflux or other causes\n2.

  "tests_referrals_planned": "The plan includes several diagnostic steps that will guide the treatment pathway:\n\n1. Comprehensive physical exam of the throat, neck, and larynx.\n2. Laryngoscopy if indicated.\n3. Blood tests to assess overall health and possible cancer biomarkers.\n4. Imaging studies (CT or MRI) to visualize structures and aid staging.\n5. Depending on findings, biopsy may be performed under local anesthesia; results typically available in days to weeks.\n6. Pathology reports will inform staging and subsequent treatment decisions.\n7. A multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting will determine the exact stage and tailor the treatment plan after pathology results.\n\nIn essence, these tests aim to establish the extent of disease and guide the choice between surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or combinations thereof. The MDT will integrate the pathology report into their final recommendations. The patient and family will receive clear explanations and timelines for each step.",
  "follow_up_plan": "The follow-up plan includes:\n\n1. Complete diagnostic workup: Continue with blood tests, imaging (CT/MRI), and any necessary biopsy.\n2. Imaging timing: Decide between CT and MRI based on findings; CT is often used first due to its faster turnaround.\n3. Pathology results: Biopsy results will guide staging and subsequent treatment decisions.\n4. Staging framework: TNM system explained; Stage III typically involves larger tumor and/or nodal involvement without distant metastasis.\n5. Treatment planning: Based on stage, possible modalities include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or combinations; multimodal therapy is common.\n6. Supportive care: Nutrition, dental hygiene, and psychological support emphasized; ongoing counseling and resources offered.\n7.
