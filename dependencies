Great, this is a strong prior art and the examiner’s concern is reasonable.
Below are clear, defensible differentiators you can use directly in the patent response.
I’ve written them in patent-appropriate language, mapped explicitly against CN117932042A, and focused on non-obvious technical gaps.

Differentiation of Trust-X vs CN117932042A

High-level distinction (one-paragraph summary)

CN117932042A discloses a dialogue-based evaluation pipeline for assessing whether a single large language model acting as a doctor can retrieve predefined patient information, ask appropriate questions, and match diagnoses or treatments against standardized answers.
In contrast, Trust-X introduces a trustworthiness measurement framework that evaluates how models reason and act under uncertainty and safety constraints, using multi-agent consensus, explicit epistemic uncertainty modeling, reasoning–diagnosis consistency, and real-time safety supervision of actions (tests and prescriptions). Trust-X measures process-level reliability, not merely outcome correctness or dialogue completeness.

Point-by-point technical differentiators

1. Single-agent evaluation vs multi-agent epistemic uncertainty modeling

CN117932042A
	•	Evaluates one doctor agent interacting with a patient agent.
	•	No notion of epistemic uncertainty.
	•	Assumes correctness is measured by matching against standardized patient information.
	•	Disagreement or uncertainty is not modeled.

Trust-X (Inventive Step)
	•	Introduces multiple independent Doctor Agents (K ≥ 3) reasoning in parallel on the same case.
	•	Defines Consensus Disagreement Rate (CDR) as a quantitative epistemic uncertainty signal:
\mathrm{CDR} = 1 - \frac{\max_d f(d)}{K}
	•	Uses disagreement itself as a behavioral signal of uncertainty, not an error.
	•	This transforms evaluation from single-path correctness to population-level reasoning stability.

➡ Not disclosed or suggested in CN117932042A.

⸻

2. Outcome scoring vs reasoning-process trustworthiness

CN117932042A
	•	Evaluation indices are based on:
	•	Keyword matching
	•	Diagnostic correctness
	•	Treatment plan correctness
	•	Dialogue completeness
	•	Focus is on what answer was produced.

Trust-X
	•	Introduces Epistemic Trust Index (ETI) that combines:
	•	Accuracy
	•	Consensus stability (1 − CDR)
	•	Reasoning–Diagnosis Consistency (RDC)
	•	Explicitly separates:
	•	Epistemic reliability (quality of reasoning)
	•	Operational safety (quality of actions)
	•	Evaluates how the diagnosis was reasoned, not just correctness.

➡ CN117932042A has no notion of reasoning trust as a measurable construct.

⸻

3. No reasoning validation vs Reasoning–Diagnosis Consistency (RDC)

CN117932042A
	•	Does not analyze internal reasoning traces.
	•	Uses keyword overlap and logical sequence comparison against predefined rules.
	•	Does not assess alignment between explanation and final decision.

Trust-X
	•	Introduces RDC, computed as semantic similarity between:
	•	The model’s reasoning trace
	•	The model’s final diagnosis
	•	Uses embedding-based consistency, not rule matching.
	•	Detects plausible-sounding but logically disconnected reasoning.

➡ This is a new metric category absent from the prior art.

⸻

4. Passive hallucination detection vs active safety supervision

CN117932042A
	•	Detects hallucination after the fact:
	•	If value cannot be retrieved
	•	If diagnosis mismatches standard answer
	•	Safety is treated as a binary evaluation label.

Trust-X
	•	Introduces real-time Safety Agents that:
	•	Intercept unsafe tests before execution
	•	Flag unsafe prescriptions using external medical knowledge (e.g., DrugBank)
	•	Measures:
	•	UnsafeRx%
	•	TestAlert%
	•	Safety actively shapes the reasoning trajectory.

➡ CN117932042A does not supervise actions, only evaluates outputs.

⸻

5. Dialogue completeness metrics vs Operational Safety Index (OSI)

CN117932042A
	•	Penalizes or rewards based on:
	•	Number of dialogue rounds
	•	Coverage of predefined patient attributes
	•	More dialogue ≈ better evaluation.

Trust-X
	•	Introduces Operational Safety Index (OSI):
	•	Explicitly set to 0 when safety supervision is disabled
	•	Penalizes unsafe behavior rather than rewarding silence
	•	Prevents “safe-by-omission” scoring.

➡ This resolves a known evaluation loophole not addressed in CN117932042A.

⸻

6. Evaluation of correctness vs evaluation of trustworthiness

CN117932042A
	•	Core objective: “evaluate ability of LLM in diagnosis and treatment”
	•	Measures correctness, coverage, and dialogue logic.

Trust-X
	•	Core objective: measure trustworthiness under realistic deployment constraints
	•	Explicitly distinguishes:
	•	Accuracy ≠ Reliability
	•	Coherence ≠ Safety
	•	Provides FTI as a synthesis of epistemic and operational trust.

➡ Trust-X addresses a different technical problem.

Key legal framing for the patent response

You can safely state:

Although CN117932042A evaluates diagnostic correctness and dialogue quality of a single large language model, it does not disclose or suggest a system for measuring trustworthiness through multi-agent consensus, epistemic uncertainty quantification, reasoning–diagnosis consistency, or real-time safety supervision of clinical actions. Trust-X therefore introduces a distinct technical solution to a different technical problem: evaluating process-level reliability rather than outcome-level correctness.

⸻

One-line differentiator (for examiner summary)

CN117932042A evaluates whether a model gives the right answer; Trust-X evaluates whether the model reasons reliably, safely, and transparently under uncertainty.
