Below is a patent-ready differentiation between Trust-X and prior art RASC (Reasoning-Aware Self-Consistency), written in a style suitable for an Inventor’s Comment / Response to Searcher. I’ve also implicitly incorporated what is known from the paper (no need to over-cite web details in patent response).

Differentiation of Trust-X vs

Reasoning-Aware Self-Consistency (RASC)
(Wan et al., 2025)

⸻

High-level distinction (core inventive boundary)

The cited prior art RASC proposes a mechanism to optimize LLM sampling efficiency and answer faithfulness by scoring reasoning paths during inference and selecting the best rationale to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations.

In contrast, Trust-X is not a sampling, decoding, or answer-selection technique.
Trust-X introduces a system and method for measuring the trustworthiness of medical LLM behavior, integrating epistemic uncertainty, reasoning–decision alignment, and operational safety supervision into explicit trust indices.

Thus, RASC operates at the inference optimization layer, while Trust-X operates at the post-reasoning evaluation and accountability layer.

Point-by-point technical differentiators

1. Inference optimization vs trust measurement

RASC
	•	Objective: improve efficiency and faithfulness of inference.
	•	Uses reasoning evaluation to:
	•	stop sampling early,
	•	select the “best” rationale,
	•	produce a single final answer.
	•	Reasoning quality is a means to improve output accuracy.

Trust-X (Inventive Step)
	•	Objective: measure trustworthiness, not improve inference.
	•	Does not alter sampling, decoding, or answer selection.
	•	Uses reasoning evaluation to:
	•	quantify epistemic uncertainty,
	•	detect reasoning instability,
	•	expose unsafe behavior.
	•	Trust is treated as an observable, measurable system property, not an optimization objective.

➡ Trust-X solves a different technical problem than RASC.

2. Reasoning–answer scoring vs Reasoning–Diagnosis Consistency (RDC)

RASC
	•	Scores reasoning paths to choose the most faithful rationale.
	•	Scoring is used internally to guide weighted majority voting.
	•	The selected rationale replaces others.

Trust-X
	•	Introduces Reasoning–Diagnosis Consistency (RDC) as an evaluation metric, not a selection criterion.
	•	RDC measures semantic alignment between:
	•	the reasoning trace,
	•	the final diagnosis.
	•	RDC is reported and logged, not used to select or modify outputs.
	•	Multiple inconsistent but fluent reasonings are explicitly preserved for analysis.

➡ RDC is used to evaluate coherence, not to enforce it.

⸻

3. Single-model self-consistency vs multi-agent epistemic disagreement

RASC
	•	Operates on multiple samples from the same model.
	•	Self-consistency is used to converge on one answer.
	•	Disagreement is transient and discarded once a rationale is selected.

Trust-X
	•	Uses multiple independent Doctor Agents with separate reasoning trajectories.
	•	Introduces Consensus Disagreement Rate (CDR):
	•	disagreement is explicitly measured,
	•	disagreement is treated as epistemic uncertainty.
	•	No attempt is made to eliminate disagreement.

➡ Using disagreement as a trust signal (CDR) is not taught or suggested in RASC.

⸻

4. Answer faithfulness vs operational safety monitoring

RASC
	•	Focuses entirely on reasoning faithfulness and efficiency.
	•	No concept of:
	•	test safety,
	•	prescription safety,
	•	real-time safety supervision.
	•	No notion of unsafe actions.

Trust-X
	•	Introduces Operational Safety Index (OSI).
	•	Monitors:
	•	unsafe prescriptions,
	•	unsafe diagnostic tests,
	•	DDIs and contraindications.
	•	OSI is explicitly defined as zero when safety supervision is absent, preventing score inflation.

➡ Operational safety as a quantified trust dimension is absent from RASC.

⸻

5. Efficiency–accuracy trade-off vs accountability and auditability

RASC
	•	Goal: reduce number of samples while maintaining accuracy.
	•	No logging or traceability guarantees.
	•	No audit trail for how reasoning evolved.

Trust-X
	•	Provides:
	•	end-to-end reasoning logs,
	•	agent-level traces,
	•	replayable diagnostic timelines.
	•	Designed for auditing, accountability, and regulatory inspection, not speed.

➡ Trust-X addresses regulatory trust requirements, not computational efficiency.

⸻

6. General QA setting vs safety-critical medical reasoning

RASC
	•	Evaluated on general QA datasets.
	•	No domain-specific safety implications.

Trust-X
	•	Designed specifically for safety-critical medical reasoning.
	•	Trust metrics explicitly distinguish:
	•	“correct but unsafe”,
	•	“coherent but negligent”,
	•	“safe and accountable” behavior.

➡ Trust-X operates under constraints absent in RASC.

⸻

Examiner-facing concise differentiation (recommended text)

The cited RASC framework evaluates reasoning paths to optimize sampling efficiency and select a single faithful rationale during inference. In contrast, the present invention does not modify inference or select among reasoning paths. Instead, it introduces a system and method for measuring the trustworthiness of medical large language model behavior, using multi-agent diagnostic disagreement as a signal of epistemic uncertainty, reasoning–diagnosis consistency as an evaluative metric, and real-time safety supervision as an operational trust dimension. Disagreement and unsafe behavior are preserved, logged, and quantified rather than eliminated. These aspects are neither disclosed nor suggested by RASC, which focuses on efficiency and accuracy rather than trust, accountability, or safety measurement.

⸻

One-line differentiator (for claim mapping)

RASC selects the best reasoning to answer a question; Trust-X measures whether any reasoning can be trusted to act safely.

⸻

Key novelty summary (bullet-ready)
	•	RASC: inference-time optimization
	•	Trust-X: post-reasoning trust quantification
	•	RASC: removes disagreement
	•	Trust-X: measures disagreement (CDR)
	•	RASC: no safety dimension
	•	Trust-X: explicit OSI with zero-safety penalty
	•	RASC: single answer focus
	•	Trust-X: system-level accountability framework
