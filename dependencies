Key findings across four system configurations:

• Diagnostic accuracy remains stable across all systems (~68–69%)  

• Systems without safety agents (Baseline, Consensus) receive OSI = 0  
  → they appear accurate but are not operationally trustworthy  

• Safety and Trust modes achieve high Final Trust Index (≈ 75)  
  → due to active detection of unsafe tests and prescriptions  

• Trust-X achieves the best balance of:
  – reasoning coherence  
  – uncertainty awareness  
  – and clinical safety  

• Trust is driven by behavior and transparency, not raw accuracy
