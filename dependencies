Trust-X is a transparent, safety-aware multi-agent framework for clinical reasoning.

It combines:
• Independent Doctor Agents to capture epistemic uncertainty  
• Consensus reasoning to measure diagnostic disagreement (CDR)  
• Real-time safety agents to monitor tests and prescriptions  
• Continuous reasoning logs for auditability and traceability  
• Quantitative trust scores (ETI, OSI, FTI) linking reasoning to safety  

Trust-X does not just predict — it exposes, verifies, and measures how decisions are made.
