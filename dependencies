📧 Email Draft to Supervisor — Request for GPT API Access

Subject: Request for GPT API Access for Medical Dialogue Summarisation Project (EACL Deadline: 19 December)

Dear [Supervisor’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well. I am writing to request API access to the OpenAI GPT models (GPT-4.1 / GPT-4o / o1 / o1-mini) for our ongoing research on medical dialogue summarisation for low-resource Indic languages, which we plan to submit to EACL 2025 (deadline: 19 December).

⸻

🔍 Research Problem

Our project focuses on building high-quality summarisation systems for doctor–patient dialogues in Hindi, Marathi, Bangla, and Tamil.
Each dialogue in our dataset is paired with:
	•	a short English clinical summary
	•	a structured JSON clinical summary
	•	metadata fields

Our goal is to investigate how different styles of intermediate reasoning and structured transformation can improve summarisation quality when training small and efficient open-source models (Qwen 1.5B / 7B).

⸻

🧪 Planned Experiments

We plan to conduct the following experiments:

1. Generate high-quality structured reasoning from GPT

We will use GPT to produce:
	•	step-by-step structured medical reasoning
	•	interpretable intermediate summaries
	•	clean clinical explanations of the dialogue

These GPT-generated reasoning traces will be used as training signals to improve small open-source models.

2. Fine-tune open-source models

We will fine-tune Qwen 1.5B and Qwen 7B using:
	•	basic text summaries
	•	structured JSON summaries
	•	GPT-generated structured reasoning

and compare which leads to the best summarisation performance.

3. Use GPT as an “LLM-as-a-judge”

For evaluation, we will use GPT to:
	•	assess factual correctness
	•	score clinical accuracy
	•	detect hallucinations
	•	evaluate adherence to summarisation instructions

This is critical because human clinical evaluation for 7–9 languages is not feasible within the short timeframe.

4. Compare summarisation styles

Our goal is to show:
	•	how structured reasoning improves summarisation
	•	which training strategy generalizes best across the four Indic languages
	•	how small models can be made more clinically reliable

⸻

🎯 Why GPT Access Is Essential

To run this project properly and meet the EACL deadline:

✔ We need high-quality reasoning signals

Open-source models do not reliably generate clean, medically accurate intermediate reasoning without strong supervision. GPT models produce:
	•	consistent
	•	factual
	•	structured
	•	multilingual

reasoning, which we need to build our training dataset.

✔ We need GPT for LLM-as-a-judge evaluation

Many of the evaluation aspects—clinical correctness, insightfulness, risk-related hallucinations—require a high-accuracy judge model. GPT-4-class models are currently the best available option for this.

✔ We need stable, high-throughput generation

To prepare the dataset and run our experiments, we need reliable generation that:
	•	handles long dialogues
	•	maintains structure
	•	stays consistent across languages

GPT models are significantly more robust for this purpose.

⏳ Deadline

The submission deadline for EACL is 19 December, so it is important to begin dataset generation and model training as soon as possible.

⸻

🙏 Request

I kindly request access to the OpenAI GPT API, preferably with enough quota to:
	•	generate structured reasoning for our multilingual dataset
	•	run evaluation using GPT as an LLM judge
	•	iterate on modelling experiments before the submission deadline

I will maintain a detailed record of usage and ensure efficient cost management.

Please let me know if you’d like a short discussion—I can walk through the experiment plan and timeline in more detail. Thank you very much for your support.

If you’d like, I can also:

✔ provide a shorter, one-paragraph version
✔ write a version tailored to industry, academia, or government
✔ prepare a budget estimate showing expected API usage costs
