The Trust-X framework was designed based on the Google Gemini LLMs. Using 50 diagnostic cases from the MedQA benchmark, the authors evaluated Trust-X regarding its accuracy, reasoning quality, safety and explainability, etc.. Experimental results show that accuracy alone cannot represent the performance of clinical LLMs, reliability of the models must be evaluated through transparency and accountability. The topic fits the scope of SECURE-AI4H. The findings may potentially contribute to the safe deployment of LLMs for medical diagnosis.

More explanation should be given about the model configuration. For example, what is the difference between the three doctor agents? Also, space issues exist between the paragraphs in page 4
