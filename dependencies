Abstract
Despite the growing clinical adoption of large language models (LLMs), current approaches heavily rely on single-model architectures. To overcome risks of obsolescence and rigid dependence on single model systems, we present a novel framework, termed the Consensus Mechanism, which has been designed to flexibly integrate the strengths of multiple "expert’" models. Mimicking clinical triage and multidisciplinary clinical decision-making, the Consensus Mechanism implements an ensemble of specialized medical "expert" agents enabling unprecedented performance on medical benchmarks and robust adaptability as newer LLMs become available. This process enables the Consensus Mechanism to be optimized for cost, latency, or performance, purely based on the interior model configuration.

In this paper, we introduce the Consensus Mechanism, or Sully Medical Consensus 1 (MedCon-1), a dynamic and modular framework designed to meet the aforementioned challenges with current methods. Through the orchestration of multiple independently configurable LLMs as domain-specific "expert agents", the system simulates real-world clinical decision making via downstream expert deliberation.
Design Overview 
At its core, the Consensus Mechanism is a modular clinical reasoning framework that synthesizes the best aspects of each expert to generate a robust and diverse response for a given task. Unlike a traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or standard Mixtureof-Experts (MoE) approach, the Consensus Mechanism builds on both of these methods by defining the role of each expert through a chain of thought like decomposition. This is accomplished by a triage model which assigns the relevant medical specialists based on a clinical task. Each expert then independently analyzes the task explicitly from its respective specialist perspective and reports back a probability distribution of correct answers. Embracing the interdisciplinary and probabilistic nature of medicine, the individual distributions are then aggregated and weighted. A final consensus model is then given each expert’s analysis, and the recalculated probability distribution, allowing it to synthesize a unified, well-supported output.
Consensus implements a triage-inspired system that delegates a respective query to a panel of specialized LLM experts. Each expert is instantiated as a distinct, publicly available model configured to a particular medical specialty. This configuration is determined based on the task analysis outputted by the triage agent. The triage agent orchestrates this initial decomposition by identifying the type of medical task and dividing the problem among a synergistic group of domain-specific models[13] . When prompted, the triage agent first performs a preliminary assessment to infer the task type, then routes the query to the most appropriate set of downstream medical specialists. The preliminary analysis enables the agent to draw out important contextual signals from the input query, improving the relevance and coverage of the selected experts. We define the input medical query as Q, which is processed by a triage LLM to return the task type and best suited medical specialties to handle the respective query:
 
The overall design builds on the fundamental principles of CoT reasoning and MoE modeling. Our approach achieves a similar end goal of structured reasoning, but by distributing the reasoning across multiple domain-focused agents instead of a single model’s internal sub-experts[13],[14] . Though MoE generally applies to a single-model system, we extrapolated the technique to a multi-model expert block to leverage increased diversity[15] . Each independent viewpoint captures the multi-dimensional nature of clinical reasoning without placing overwhelming pressure on any one model. This allows consensus to cover a broader diagnostic space than any single generalist model.
